# File Downloader
A very simple binge file downloader written in Go, to familiarize myself with the language.

It downloads the files from all the URLs in a list

> The name for the downloaded files, will be the resource path of the URL 

## Usage
Clone or download the repo, list your URLs (one by line) in a file.
Then pass the path to that file as an argument to the go run command:

```sh
$ cd file-downloader
$ go run downloader.go urls.txt
```
